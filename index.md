### Academic Projects 

[Music Genre Prediction](https://github.com/akshay33/MIRSystem)
- Created a system that predicts Music Genre using the FMA 2017 medium dataset.
- Implemented different algorithms for comparative analysis where Neural Networks(MLP) performed better than others and giving accuracy of 59% which was more than the benchmarks (58%).
- Implemented SMOTE algorithm to create synthetic data samples which improved accuracy to 63%.

---
[Learning to Drive using Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://akshay33.github.io/)
- Created a simulated driving domain using v-rep platform.
- Implemented Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning algorithm and tested in the simulated domain
with small and large state space where it was able to drive accurately.

---
[Deep Reinforcement Learning agent for Pacman](https://akshay33.github.io/)
- Developed and Integrated Deep Reinforcement learning agent with existing Pacman Agent Framework and
obtained 90% winning rate.
- Deep Neural Network was created using Keras and Image processing was done using PIL and OpenCV in Python 2.7.
